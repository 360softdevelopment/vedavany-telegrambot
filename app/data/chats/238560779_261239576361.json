Can Telegram bot change available reactions on messages?\nGive example using telegraf library."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes, it is possible to change available reactions on messages in a Telegram bot using the Telegraf library. \n\nHere's an example code snippet which shows how to use the `setMyCommands` method in Telegraf to change the available reactions on messages:\n\n```javascript\nconst { Telegraf } = require('telegraf');\n\nconst bot = new Telegraf(process.env.BOT_TOKEN);\n\nbot.command('setreactions', async (ctx) => {\n  const newReactions = [\n    { command: 'thumbsup', description: 'Thumbs Up 👍' },\n    { command: 'heart', description: 'Heart ❤️' },\n    { command: 'smile', description: 'Smiling Face 😀' },\n  ];\n\n  const result = await ctx.telegram.setMyCommands(newReactions);\n  console.log(result);\n\n  ctx.reply('New reactions have been set!');\n});\n\nbot.launch();\n```\n\nIn this code, we define a new array of reactions (`newReactions`) with three different reactions, and use the `setMyCommands` method to set them as the available reactions for the bot. The `setMyCommands` method updates the bot's list of commands, which includes both text commands and reactions. \n\nAfter running this code and sending the `/setreactions` command to the bot, the available reactions in the chat will now include the three new reactions we defined.\n\nI hope this helps you!"},{"role":"user","content":"Test"},{"role":"assistant","content":"I'm here!

Since I'm not sure what exactly you would like an example of related to the teachings of Bhakti Rakshak Sridhar Dev-Goswami Maharaj, here's a basic JavaScript function that can be used to calculate the factorial of a number:\n\n```\nfunction factorial(n) {\n  if (n === 0) {\n    return 1;\n  } else {\n    return n * factorial(n - 1);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis function recursively calculates the factorial of a number by multiplying the number by the previous number until it reaches 1. For example, `factorial(5)` returns `120` (5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1).\n\nI hope this example is helpful to you!

The `response` object is then parsed using the `json()` method to extract JSON data, which is then logged to the console using `console.log()`. The `catch` block is used to handle any errors that occur during the request.\n\nI hope this helps!
