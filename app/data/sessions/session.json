We should seek the guidance of other sincere and advanced devotees in our search for a guru. They can help us to understand and identify the qualities of a true guru.\n\nWhen we find a genuine guru, we should accept him or her as our spiritual guide and submit ourselves to their guidance. The relationship between the guru and the disciple is based on love and trust, and it is important to maintain a sincere and open-minded approach to learning and growing under their guidance."
